This task focuses on the amount of light let in, or the dimming of a light using a potentiometer. The potentiometer is rotated clockwise to dim and anti clockwise to brighten. This is possible with the coding, setting the 'light state' variable to 1 when turned on. The light state is on a forever loop and when the knob is rotated, it sends the infomation to the output, which determines the brightness of the light.

In this experiment, I learnt how this whole concept works with the coding and building. A key aspect I learnt about was the purpose of the resistor and what it does. The resistor controls the amount of power sent to somthing and in this case it was the LED light. I experimented with this and removed the resistor and it allowed for a much brighter output in the light. Diffrent types of resistors contain more or less output depending on what is being used and what the project it. 

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application as seen in many house holds with indoor and outdoor lighting. This concept is seen in households as a knob is rotated to control the dimness or brightness of lights.
